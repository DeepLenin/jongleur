"""
The main point of this package is to give easy and standardized way to infer on
several sets of data and analyze differences of outputs.

We plan to give convention to use this instrument properly with any framework
and kind of data you possibly need: basically you'll implement most of low
level coding which will be really similar to code you use in your
training/validation pipeline.
